# Project Status

Each project in the bitlap organization namespace has a _Stage Badge_ which indicates the current status of that project:

| Stage | Description |
|-------|-------------|
|![Production Ready](https://img.shields.io/badge/Project%20Stage-Production%20Ready-brightgreen.svg) | The project is stable and already used in production. We can expect reliability for the implemented use cases. |
| ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/Project%20Stage-Development-yellowgreen.svg) | The project already has RC or milestone releases but is still under active development. We should not expect full stability yet. | 
| ![Experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/Project%20Stage-Experimental-orange.svg) | The project is not yet released, but an important part of the work is already done. |
| ![Research](https://img.shields.io/badge/Project%20Stage-Research-orange.svg) | The project is at the design stage, with some sketches of work but nothing usable yet. |
| ![Concept](https://img.shields.io/badge/Project%20Stage-Concept-orange.svg) | The project is just an idea, and the development hasn't started yet. |
